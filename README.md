# üè• Patient Management System
A modular, production-grade backend for healthcare platforms‚Äîbuilt with Spring Boot, gRPC, Kafka, and Protobuf. Designed for clarity, scalability, and real-world hospital workflows.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository contains **backend services only**. There is **no UI layer**. All modules are API-first, integration-ready, and built for reviewer-grade clarity.

---

## üß† What This System Solves

Modern healthcare platforms require:

- Secure onboarding of patients with validated data
- Automated billing tied to patient creation
- Real-time analytics for operational insights
- Stateless authentication and role-based access
- Clear service boundaries for scalability and maintainability

This system delivers those capabilities through a clean, event-driven architecture.

## üîó Service Interactions

| Source           | Target            | Protocol | Contract             |
|------------------|-------------------|----------|----------------------|
| `patient-service`| `billing-service` | gRPC     | `billing_service.proto` |
| `patient-service`| `analytics-service`| Kafka   | `patient_event.proto`   |
| `api-gateway`    | All services      | HTTP     | REST + Swagger       |

---

## üß© Module Highlights

### `patient-service`
- RESTful CRUD for patient records
- DTO validation with group constraints
- gRPC call to billing-service
- Kafka event emission (`PatientCreated`)
- PostgreSQL persistence with UUIDs

### `auth-service`
- Stateless JWT authentication
- Login and token refresh endpoints
- Role-based access control

### `billing-service`
- gRPC server exposing `CreateBillingAccount`
- Protobuf-based request/response
- Isolated billing logic

### `analytics-service`
- Kafka consumer for patient events
- Aggregates metrics for reporting
- Exposes REST endpoints for insights

### `api-gateway`
- Routes external requests to internal services
- Handles fallback, CORS, and routing logic

---

## üß† Real-World Justification

- **Event-Driven Design:** Patient creation triggers billing and analytics asynchronously‚Äîmirroring real hospital workflows.
- **gRPC for Internal RPC:** Fast, typed communication between services with Protobuf contracts‚Äîideal for low-latency backend calls.
- **Kafka for Observability:** Decoupled event stream enables real-time insights without impacting core flows.
- **Strict Boundaries:** Each module owns its domain‚Äîno shared databases, no cross-service leaks.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code Ready:** Dockerfiles, secrets, and configs are modular and production-grade.
- **Reviewer-Grade Clarity:** Every folder, contract, and interaction is annotated for instant understanding.

---

## üìò Notes

- This system is backend-only. There is no frontend or UI layer.
- All services are designed for API-level integration and orchestration.
- Folder boundaries are strictly maintained for clarity and reproducibility.
- Use exact versions for compatibility.
